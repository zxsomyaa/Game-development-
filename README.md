# Game Development / Image Processing Application

An interactive 2D game developed using **p5.js**, focusing on real-time animation, sound integration, and user interaction. The project demonstrates core game development concepts including character movement, collision handling, scoring mechanics, and multimedia integration.

This application was developed as part of an academic coursework and showcases practical implementation of game logic, asset handling, and canvas-based rendering using JavaScript.
